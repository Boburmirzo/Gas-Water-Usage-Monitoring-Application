# Gas & Water Usage Monitoring Application

Create an application to monitor gas, 
cold and hot water usage. No UI needed, only REST API. Two REST API methods should be implemented: one for submitting the current measurements for a given user, other for getting the history of previously submitted measurements for a given user. Method inputs should be validated to reject incomplete or invalid data.
